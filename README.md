# Subdistribution-beta-Stacy
The following code can be used to reproduced the analyses of the paper "Reinforced urns and the subdistribution beta-Stacy process prior for competing risks analysis" by Andrea Arf√®, Stefano Peluso, and Pietro Muliere.

## Code description:
1. *functions.R*: contains the definitions of all functions required for the analyses.
2. *melanoma_gender_m1.R*: program for the analysis of Section 7 with m=1.
3. *melanoma_gender_m1000.R*: program for the analysis of Section 7 with m=1000.
4. *melanoma_gender_m1e6.R*: program for the analysis of Section 7 with m=1000000.
5. *melanoma_gender_m1_lognormal.R*: program for the analyses in the Supplementary Material, Appendix C, with m=1.
6. *melanoma_gender_m1000_lognormal.R*: program for the analyses in the Supplementary Material, Appendix C, with m=1.
7. *melanoma_gender_m1e6_lognormal.R*: program for the analyses in the Supplementary Material, Appendix C, with m=1000000.
8. *plot_pred_dist.R*: plot of the predictive distributions for the analysis of Section 7.
9. *plot_pred_dist_lognormal.R*: plot of the predictive distributions for the analysis in the Supplementary Material, Appendix C.
10. *predictive_checks.R*: program to perform the predictive checks in the Supplementary Material, Appendix B.
11. *prior_simulations.R*: program to perform the analyses in the Supplementary Material, Appendix A.
12. *prior_standard_dev.R*: program to generate Figure 2 of Section 7.
